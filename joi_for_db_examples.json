However, these graph-based methods are specifically designed for the ranking of authors in a citation network and/or co-authorship network, which need complicated preliminary calculation to ensure the feasibility for all field of science. Additionally, author-level publishing performance Index (PPI) considers citations, field of research, academic age, and number and sequence of authors as well. But the research filed of PPI was to limit the nominee within certain disciplines (\u3010#bib0065\u3011). Additionally, the author list does not follow any universally agreed-upon standard; it requires empirical testing to validate new scholar impact indicators. Even though the large publication databases, such as Web of Science (WoS), Elsevier Scopus, and arXiv.org, classify the indexed journals into comprehensive subject categories, a journal could belong to more than one category.

In LIS disciplines, journal papers are important for scholar performance assessment. The literature types indexed in the WoS for the LIS category include: 69.50% journal papers, 5.40% book reviews, 4.13% proceedings papers, and some other types of literature. We focus on journal papers in this study. Many studies have focused on scholar impact evaluation to measure the scientific contribution of each scholar. The evaluation result could influence scientific resource distribution, such as academic awards and foundation applications (\u3010#bib71\u3011); (\u3010#bib72\u3011). Traditional scholar impact evaluation methods fall into two categories: citation count-based methods (\u3010#bib0042\u3011;\u3010#bib0041\u3011) and network-based methods (\u3010#bib0044\u3011;\u3010#bib0043\u3011). By contrast, performance assessment involves conveying a rational design and execution procedure with the tasks of designing, executing, interpreting, or evaluating a performance assessment for use by government, business, industry, the military, certification and licensing agencies, and educational institutions (\u3010#bib0045\u3011). In this context, scholar performance assessment may include not only citation counts but also their educational background, courses feedback, research topics, publications, and research funding experience. Scholar performance assessment is mainly applied between nation, university departments, or individuals (\u3010#bib0046\u3011). The NSAP aims to overcome the shortcomings of raw citation count-based indicators for scholar rank by combining with topic, author sequence, author role, and journal-level normalized indicators. Therefore, we defined NSAP as a scholar performance assessment indicator.", "terms": "category; information science; literature; impact; citation; performance", "section_id": 1, "section_title": "Introduction"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.joi.2021.101201", "cover_date": "2021-11-30", "country": "China; Republic of Korea", "para": "NSAP considers four factors because that is how it can overcome the raw citation problems. Features that compute for those factors are easy to collect or generate. The author impact can be compared on the basis of productivity, author impact, article impact, and article quality (\u3010#bib0037\u3011). For multi-author articles, author impact was allocated in accordance with author sequence and author role in the multi-author list. Bibliometrics evaluates the impact and quality of papers. Impact is measured via citations collected by papers, while quality is determined by the impact factor. Experience has demonstrated that in each specialty the best journals are those in which it is most difficult to have an article accepted and these are the journals that have a high impact factor (\u3010#bib0063\u3011). Furthermore, citations collected by articles increase over time, which means time-normalization of citations in necessary for scientific evaluation. Author impact assessment should consider the publication environment of specific research topics. With these objectives in mind, we designed the NSAP indicator. For research topic generation, we train keywords occurrence network embedding and word embedding to represent the structural and semantic features, while each keyword is represented using the concatenated vector of these two embeddings. K-means cluster algorithm is applied to cluster the keyword. For the calculation design of NSAP, the author sequence and role are identified to allocate authorship credit, following which the corresponding author and first author are identified using the WoS record. Then, the authorship credit is tagged with the paper topics. Later, the topic-level authorship credit is weighted by multiplying it with the field-normalized indicator of the corresponding journal. The journal indicator includes three field-normalized indicators proposed by the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS): Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP), SCImago Journal Rankings (SJR), and CiteScore. Journal impact factor (JIF) proposed by Web of Science is also considered. NSAP is the sum of every topic-level authorship credit.

There are also opinions against the author sequence-based authorship credit allocation model because of alphabetical author signature in some disciplines and the statement of author contribution. The use of alphabetical authorship is declining over time; it commonly exists in mathematics, economics (including finance), and high-energy physics. The consistently declining trend is proved via an empirical analysis of the use of alphabetical authorship in scientific publishing covering all fields of science (\u3010#bib0048\u3011).

In traditional bibliometric analysis, author keywords play a critical role in co-term analysis and capturing topic terms (\u3010#bib0015\u3011). Keywords that accompany an article are usually abstract definitions of the main research context on which the article focuses (\u3010#bib0003\u3011). Recent co-term analysis used for topic identification is a content analysis method combining bibliometrics and deep learning technology to reveal the deep meaning of documents. Bibliometrics counts the frequency of word co-occurrence in a document and clusters these words based on co-occurrence to reveal the closeness between them. This analysis usually suggests that the higher the frequency of words\u2019 co-occurrence within a document, the closer they are (\u3010#bib0030\u3011). Measuring the distance of keywords in a co-keyword network can indicate the research similarity of each keyword. This research similarity is slightly different from semantic relatedness as the context word is not a sentence but is another keyword studied in the same paper. Those research similarities are necessary for research topic identification. Thus, a co-keywords network was constructed. To capture more keyword relation characteristics, the network is represented as vector space using network-embedding algorithms (\u3010#bib0036\u3011). Furthermore, deep learning technology measured semantic distance between keywords based on the document as a corpus. Word embedding, as one such application of deep learning, maps words from a textual vocabulary to numeric vectors and, in doing so, creates a way to extract topics and discover the latent semantics in large-scale text (\u3010#bib0029\u3011). The key idea is that, words with similar meanings often appear in similar contexts. Word2Vec method is a well-recognized word embedding technique (\u3010#bib0034\u3011). Furthermore, a keyword vector is represented by co-keywords embedding as well as Word2Vec semantic-relatedness embedding concatenated as a new vector. Research topic identification aims to sort keywords into groups or clusters so that the degree of correlation is strong between members of the same cluster and weak between members of different clusters (\u3010#bib0007\u3011).

The publication distribution of different research topics also presents spatial heterogeneity in that hotspot topics always have many more articles than less popular ones.", "terms": "Clustering; intensity; data; Algorithm", "section_id": 2, "section_title": "Related work"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.joi.2021.101201", "cover_date": "2021-11-30", "country": "China; Republic of Korea", "para": "Affinity Propagation (AP) Clustering algorithm views each data point as a node in a network and recursively transmits real-valued messages along edges of the network until a good set of exemplars and corresponding clusters emerges (\u3010#bib0062\u3011).", "terms": "Clustering; data", "section_id": 2, "section_title": "Related work"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.joi.2021.101201", "cover_date": "2021-11-30", "country": "China; Republic of Korea", "para": "Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) is a bottom-up clustering algorithm that regards each data point as a single cluster and calculates the distance between all clusters to merge them until they are all merged.

The cluster distances of AHC could be single-link, complete-link, UPGMA, WPGMA, Centroid, or Ward (\u3010#bib0050\u3011). K-means is another commonly used document clustering method. There are studies indicating that agglomerative hierarchical clustering is better than K-means, although this result is just for a single dataset or non-document data (\u3010#bib0051\u3011). In practice, K-means is used because of its efficiency and agglomerative hierarchical clustering is used because of its quality.

Using the journal impact indicator to evaluate authors directly is against the original intention of indicator design, and JIF itself has been misused in many situations (\u3010#bib0054\u3011). Second, citation-based scholar indicators like H-index, which ignores citation time, are biased towards senior scholars and underestimates the scientific impact of junior scholars because a citation is a variable that keeps accumulating over time and articles with a longer citation window will tend to have higher citation counts than articles with shorter citation windows (\u3010#bib0055\u3011). Third, all-author citation analysis become increasingly important with the increase of multi-author scientific collaboration.

In the decade to follow, a well-recognized conception of what constitutes a GPT took hold \u2013 \u201cpervasiveness, inherent potential for technical improvements, and innovational complementarities\u201d (\u3010#bib0007\u3011) \u2013 and measuring the many and various aspects of GPTs became a topic of increasing interest for many economists. One indicator in particular, generality , has been widely applied (\u3010#bib0024\u3011), and its standard calculations consider patent citations and their technological classes. In the 2000s, however, the attention of the science, technology, and innovation (ST&I) community turned to the unique features of nanotechnologies, triggering discussions on the notion of emerging GPTs (EGPTs), i.e., emerging technologies equipped with the features of GPTs (\u3010#bib0020\u3011;\u3010#bib0063\u3011). Although much research has been undertaken to define what classifies a technology as emergent, characterizing the \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d component of an EGPT has proven to be far more difficult. Of the few studies specific to EGPTs, all assume emergence before testing constructs like generality, e.g.,\u3010#bib0052\u3011. Conversely, of the studies that primarily explore emergence,\u3010#bib0051\u3011systematic review defined five attributes of emerging technologies, theoretically guiding the development of further measurements. Such continuous interests from the ST&I community endorse the potential significance of identifying EGPTs, that is, forseeing candidates of EGPTs may help policy makers and technology managers to take pre-emptive actions in strategic plan and R&D management (e.g., funding/investment allocation) and prepare for future global competitions. This crucial role and value of EGPTs motive our research. However, to our best knowledge, very few study has attempted to directly measure and classify emergence and generality at the same time.

Thus, this indicator reflects a technology's impact on a field, which can be thought of as the extent to which a technology is an essential component of other relevant technologies (\u3010#bib0001\u3011).

Preferential attachment has been adopted as a way of interpreting power-law distributions (\u3010#bib0001\u3011;\u3010#bib0003\u3011). Another branch of studies started from the proposal of h-index (\u3010#bib0021\u3011), an index considering the inequality of authors' citations from their different publications. When calculating the h-index of a certain author, one first shows the distribution of his/her publications' citation counts based on a descending order and then show a\u3010#inline_formula(1)\u3011(45 degree up with the horizontal axis) curve in the same coordinate system; the integer horizontal value of the intersection is defined as h-index (\u3010#bib0021\u3011). There are also related studies in this branch of studies, such as the proposal of g-index (\u3010#bib0017\u3011) and other h-type indices (e.g.,\u3010#bib0005\u3011;\u3010#bib0039\u3011), as well as applying the h-index (or h-type indices) to network (graph) contexts (e.g.,\u3010#bib0032\u3011;\u3010#bib0053\u3011;\u3010#bib0054\u3011).", "terms": "Preferential attachment; h-index; index; concept; citation", "section_id": 1, "section_title": "Background"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.joi.2021.101203", "cover_date": "2021-11-30", "country": "China", "para": "Interesting as it is, there are few studies focusing on the inequality of citation counts of all publications of individual authors, specifically, whether most citations of an author come from a great or small proportion of his/her publications.

Another limitation relates to the usage of the APS dataset. We have introduced that the APS dataset simply contains local citation relationships, i.e., citation relationship within the publications indexed by the APS dataset; therefore, citations from outside APS-recorded publications are ignored. Hence, more various citations, for instance, interdisciplinary citations, are missed. This issue might cause some biases of the current results. Nevertheless, based on the review paper of\u3010#bib0041\u3011, the citing relationships between non-physics and physics publications is not considerable compared with those within-physics publications.

Individuals collectively share responsibility and risks, obtain access to complementary resources, accumulate academic capital, accelerate the exchange of knowledge and experiences, and therefore enhance innovative research output (\u3010#bib0012\u3011;\u3010#bib0017\u3011).

To address more complex research questions and projects, scholars have tended to maintain a larger team size in recent years. According to\u3010#bib0066\u3011, the average team size of the scientific group has grown steadily since 1995 and almost doubled over 45 years (i.e., from 1.9 authors to 3.5 authors per paper). A growing team size, however, carries both benefits and drawbacks, which either contribute to or impede the knowledge-creating processes. Scientific research is substantially dependent on the presence of ample resources (Davidson\u3010#bib0014\u3011). Research resources can be classified into two broad categories: material resources and intellectual resources (\u3010#bib0030\u3011;\u3010#bib0043\u3011;\u3010#bib0067\u3011). Material resources include tangible assets used in the process of scientific research, such as funding, staff, equipment, and laboratories. Intellectual resources pertain to intangible assets, such as knowledge, information, skills, and techniques. Most studies concerning team building from the network perspective concentrate on the individual's network (a focal scholar's direct connections) (\u3010#bib0006\u3011;\u3010#bib0019\u3011;\u3010#bib0020\u3011;\u3010#bib0034\u3011;\u3010#bib0044\u3011;\u3010#bib0065\u3011). The team size can be managed and enlarged by developing more coauthors of a focal scholar (first-degree coauthors), who directly inject both material and intellectual resources to the focal scholar's research project. However, the multilayer network involves different layers, which serve as different functions or levels of systems (\u3010#bib0013\u3011;\u3010#bib0060\u3011;\u3010#bib0063\u3011). In addition to direct ties, a focal scholar is also influenced by second-degree coauthors (i.e., coauthors\u2019 coauthors), who indirectly transmit intellectual resources through intermediated coauthors. Team building through first-degree and second-degree coauthors enables scholars with complementary skills to interact with each other to effectively conduct scientific research. However, team building also carries costs. The start-up costs resulting from connecting and establishing relationships with others and maintenance costs such as communication and coordination efforts among first- and second-degree coauthors reduce the effectiveness of scientific production (\u3010#bib0007\u3011;\u3010#bib0059\u3011).

Since the mid-1980s, an increasing number of research papers have cited works outside their own research fields, suggesting that interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research is increasing (\u3010#bib0058\u3011). In response to the emerging need to integrate knowledge from different research disciplines, scholars are more frequently working with collaborators spanning diverse research fields (\u3010#bib0011\u3011). In addition to concentrating on single or a few research fields, some scholars appreciate disparate research interests across disciplines. Nevertheless, empirical evidence about the association between team size and focal scholars\u2019 research productivity and impact under different degrees of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary scope remains unexplored. Furthermore, the investigations of team size mostly center on the first-degree network, suggesting the direct influence of coauthors on the focal scholar's research performance. Having social relationships within and outside the group, however, allows for efficiency in obtaining resources and making them available to the group (\u3010#bib0050\u3011).

With the rapid development of science, scholars have gradually adopted the two approaches of knowledge exploration and exploitation. Some scholars tend to dig into a single discipline to ensure the depth of their research, whereas others prefer a variety of research interests by entering multiple disciplines and extending their research breadth. Focusing on a specific research discipline, scholars are allowed to devote necessary time, energy, and effort to enhance their identity and mastery, which helps deepen their insights into related areas (\u3010#bib0008\u3011;\u3010#bib0036\u3011). However, scholarly visibility and innovation may be limited by narrow research disciplines (\u3010#bib0036\u3011). Scholars focusing on different research fields adopt two different approaches. One is working on multidisciplinary projects with different fields that do not require integrating diverse knowledge and fields, and the other is conducting interdisciplinary research, which \u201cintegrates perspectives, information, data, techniques, tools, concepts, and/or theories from two or more disciplines\u201d (\u3010#bib0047\u3011, p188).

We employed both research productivity and impact to measure the research performance from two dimensions. Research productivity is the total academic output of a scholar, including patents, published articles, books and databases, techniques, inventions, and collections in a time frame, among which published articles are considered to be a significant part of research productivity as they serve as an essential indicator of personal merit (\u3010#bib0067\u3011). Research impact is \u201cthe degree to which its findings are read, used, applied, built upon, and cited by researchers in their own further research and applications\u201d and is frequently represented by citation count (\u3010#bib0022\u3011, p. 36). Specifically, we measured research productivity (\u3010#inline_formula(1)\u3011) as the number of published articles coauthored by the scholar in a given time period (\u3010#bib0025\u3011). The other dimension of research performance, research impact, was measured by the newly constructed measurement average weighted citation (\u3010#inline_formula(2)\u3011). In the impact evaluation for publications, it is inevitable that a time lag effect of citation will occur. Since an article's citation number is usually low during the first few years after its debut, it will take years to reveal its full impact (\u3010#bib0040\u3011;\u3010#bib0061\u3011).

Regardless, they should find the most appropriate strategies in terms of team building to achieve their goals. To enhance research productivity, whether scholars have entered into a few or many research fields, enlarging the team size by collaborating with as many scholars as possible is a reasonable strategy to publish more articles. In addition, these scholars should also try to find coauthors with moderate size of coauthors (i.e., moderate size of second-degree coauthors), especially scholars who span varied fields of research. To enhance the research impact, scholars concentrating on limited research fields should maintain a moderate level of both first- and second-degree coauthors to obtain more citations.

Research collaborators vary with a researcher's career stage, so the members of a science team are constantly changing, leading to probable changes of researchers\u2019 roles in science teams at various career stages. Therefore, the roles in this paper are only relative to the researchers\u2019 respective science teams, and are defined as \u201crelative roles\u201d here, rather than comparing roles among researchers. In addition, different roles in the science team have different levels of importance. For example, the academic elites who have large grants, such as principal investigators (PIs), are usually senior researchers in charge of a research project or the main manager of a scientific team, playing an important role in promoting the progress of the subject field (\u3010#bib0016\u3011;\u3010#bib0026\u3011). Generally, their scientific productivity, influence, number of collaborators and other scientific research performance indicators are better than those of ordinary researchers (\u3010#bib0007\u3011;\u3010#bib0009\u3011;\u3010#bib0012\u3011;\u3010#bib0036\u3011), such as non-PIs.

According to several common characteristics of these growth patterns, they can be further divided into different \u201crelative role growth types\u201d. This paper explores the relative roles (importance) of researchers at different stages in science teams and the relative role growth types of the researchers\u2019 whole academic careers, which is helpful to formulate better career development plans, help governments and universities make more reasonable scientific research policies, cultivate principal investigators, and promote the development of disciplines.", "terms": "impact; performance", "section_id": 1, "section_title": "Introduction"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.joi.2021.101207", "cover_date": "2021-11-30", "country": "China", "para": "Collaboration networks have already been widely used in related research on scientific collaboration (\u3010#bib0010\u3011;\u3010#bib0019\u3011).

For example, \u201ctranstheoretical model\u201d may be considered as a method in some situations, however, it was described as a theory model in the Wikipedia. Therefore, we assigned it to the Theory category. In addition, if a phrase is about physical equipment, medical instrument or wearable device, rather than research method, such as algorithm, data analysis software, or scale, it is considered as a phrase of Technology rather than Research Methodology.

Because the scales of these h -like indexes differ, we cannot directly use their maximum value\u3010#inline_formula(250)\u3011for comparison purposes. In this study, the growth rate\u3010#formula(14)\u3011is used to measure sensitivity to the citations of the x -index. The higher the growth rate of\u3010#inline_formula(251)\u3011the higher is the sensitive to the citations of the x -index. In the selected h -like indexes, the A -index, R -index, and e -index can be increased infinitely, whereas the h -index and g -index are finite under a fixed\u3010#inline_formula(252)\u3011. However, as the growth rate metric is mainly determined by the ratio of the growth value to the initial value\u3010#inline_formula(253)\u3011, we argue that this metric is suitable for measuring the increase in all the selected h -like indexes. A similar concept of this ratio metric is used in different disciplines.

Understanding how interdisciplinary research affects scientific success can be enhanced by measuring and analyzing the interdisciplinarity of scientific research (\u3010#bib0041\u3011). Diversity, evenness and disparity are considered as three main dimensions of interdisciplinarity of research (L.\u3010#bib0064\u3011). Specifically, diversity (also called variety) measures how many categories of disciplines there are in a study. In bibliometrics, the predefined disciplinary categories, such as the Leuven-Budapest subject classification system, the subject categories in Web of Science or Elsevier, has been used for calculating the diversity of research or journals, from the perspectives of citation or collaboration. Meanwhile, with the development of text mining techniques such as topic modeling, entity extraction and text clustering, the research topics, the specialty of authors has also been counted to represent the diversity of research (\u3010#bib0010\u3011). The interdisciplinary score of a research gets higher if the measurement object is more diverse in the categories. Although simple and clear, these indicators suffer from the redundant classification system, the synonyms of entities, and inaccurate topic clustering (\u3010#bib0066\u3011). From the perspective of networks, the between centrality has been calculated in co-citation networks and co-author networks to measure the diversity of research or journals (L.\u3010#bib0064\u3011). However, these methods considered only the topological information of networks and ignored the nodal information. Besides, the diversity of research has also been examined from other perspectives, such as different regions, different h-index, different countries and different term functions (\u3010#bib0011\u3011;\u3010#bib0044\u3011).", "terms": "co-citation; text mining; interdisciplinarity; knowledge; classification; information; co-author; topic clustering; citation; entity", "section_id": 2, "section_title": "Related work"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.joi.2021.101216", "cover_date": "2021-11-30", "country": "China", "para": "Evenness (also called balance or symmetry) measures how much of each category of discipline there is in a research. The evenness has a positive relationship with the diversity, that is, the more even the evenness, the higher the diversity. In fact, evenness and diversity are often treated as a \u201cdual-concept\u201d index, and the evenness of research was always calculated by the normalization of the diversity (\u3010#bib0041\u3011). For example, Corr\u00eaa Jr. et\u00a0al. (\u3010#bib0016\u3011) and\u3010#bib0044\u3011employed the Shannon's entropy to normalize the diversity of author contributions and keyword term function for their calculating the evenness. Except for the Shannon's entropy, the Gini index and Simpson index have also been used for capturing the evenness in previous studies (L.\u3010#bib0064\u3011). Finally, disparity quantifies how different from each other are the disciplinary categories in a research. It also has a positive relationship with the diversity. The Rao-Stirling diversity index was a typical measure for the disparity based on network structure. However, it was demonstrated to be not convincing for measuring the interdisciplinarity of journals by (\u3010#bib0042\u3011) and (\u3010#bib0065\u3011).

When people try to build teams for a scientific project, it is not always easy to choose collaborators, especially for the leaders of large teams. Many methods have been proposed to estimate whether a paper or an author is of top impact in the past. Some methods focus on quantifying the impact of a single scholar, institution, or country. However, as collaboration increases worldwide, increasingly many people work with multiple institutions, cities, countries, and disciplines. A substantial challenge is appearing: how to handle such a complex system with multiple collaboration relationships in a single team. In the previous analysis, we find that the Q model cannot well explain the impact of the publications and career performance of scholars. High-level scientists are not easy to work with, while low-level scientists cannot guarantee the impact of a team. Even when working in large teams, some people may receive fewer citations than in typical papers. Additionally, negative and positive collaborators appear across the careers of scholars. An effective method is required to help team leaders address these issues. The funding reviewers also encounter a similar question. After team leaders build the team and apply for funding, it is difficult for reviewers to estimate the performance of the new combination. The team members may have never worked together before, and many different types of information are difficult to integrate.

Disparity measures how different are the disciplines in the reference set. The authors analyzed the impact of papers using the Normalized Citation Score (NCS). The data set used was papers from Science Citation Index-Expanded (2005). A regression estimation analysis revealed that variety was positively associated with NCS. In contrast, both balance and disparity were negatively associated with NCS.", "terms": "Disparity; impact; Variety; regression; interdisciplinarity; data; reference; citation", "section_id": 2, "section_title": "Related works"}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.joi.2021.101218", "cover_date": "2021-11-30", "country": "USA; Brazil", "para": "The impact of citing interdisciplinary papers on papers visibility was investigated by\u3010#bib0014\u3011.

The KMS-index is a continuous weighting scheme that assigns one to the American Economic Review and all other journals receive individual quality weights between zero and one. The KMS-index provides a more detailed ranking structure compared to the CL-index. However, it is possible that two papers have highly similar quality but cover completely different fields or use different methodology so that they may have very different suitability for a given journal, depending on that journal\u2019s field, focus, and style.

Let\u2019s assume that there are only two fields within economics, namely micro and macro. There are economists who work in only one field (they are specialists) and some economists do research in both fields (they are generalists). Specialists will be going to seminars and conferences in their own field, reading papers in their own field and thus becoming aware of potential co-authors in their own field. It is not that they actively avoid meeting authors from the other field, they simply do not get to meet them. Generalists, however, are more likely to meet potential co-authors in either of the two fields. In the real world, specialists in any given field are more likely to meet other specialists in the same field due to conferences and seminars they choose to attend or papers they choose to read. As a result, we would expect higher meeting probabilities\u3010#fn0010\u3011between specialists so that they get matched more to other specialists in their field rather than generalists or even less so specialists in other fields.

This may hint that intra-departmental collaborations may be driven by different mechanisms, possibly due to the lack of the bias that exists in case of the search for a distant co-author created by underlying meeting probabilities. Our analysis starts from 1990, and distant collaboration has already become fairly common among economists at this point in time as shown by\u3010#bib0041\u3011and\u3010#bib0029\u3011among others.\u3010#bib0039\u3011study the research quality of economics and finance faculty from 1970s until 2002 and show that the share of co-authored papers increases where co-authors are located at different universities and at least one co-author is at a top university.

That is, once co-authors\u2019 social networks (not just co-author networks but graduate school and affiliation networks) are accounted for, physical distance becomes irrelevant. An important finding in the innovation literature is that knowledge spillovers are geographically highly concentrated (\u3010#bib0035\u3011), nevertheless, the geographical component is shown to be substituted by inventors\u2019 social proximity (\u3010#bib0002 bib0055\u3011). What we are measuring in this paper is not explicitly knowledge spillovers, but collaboration can be considered as a specific form of knowledge diffusion between co-authors. Our extensive data on co-authors\u2019 PhD background allows us to detect social networks above and beyond what can be captured in the usual co-author networks. As a result, we are able to show that the information content of geographical distance becomes very small and its relation to field distance turns out insignificant when co-authors\u2019 social distance is accounted for. This finding connects nicely to the innovation literature where geographical localization of knowledge spillovers is shown to be captured to a large extent by the social proximity of innovators (\u3010#bib0035 bib0055\u3011).

Previous research shows a negative effect of specialization on economists\u2019 productivity and impact (\u3010#bib0006 bib0007 bib0020\u3011). We show that co-authors\u2019 specialization levels work through two channels: First, a high specialization level has an indirect positive effect on the quality of collaboration output which works through co-authors\u2019 matching such that highly specialized authors team up with those that are close in field, and such closeness is related to a high quality of collaboration output. Second, a high specialization level has a direct negative effect on the quality of collaboration output. The total effect of specialization is the sum of the direct and indirect effects and this turns out negative in most specifications. High quality research is more likely to emerge as a result of an interaction between specialists and generalists, yet, they should preferably have a close field distance. Although high specialization provides deep understanding of and strength in a topic, it does not seem to be sufficient for publishing in top journals or guarantee a high number of citations. As pointed out by\u3010#bib0045\u3011, highly specialized research teams may lack the overall intuition, which is provided by a generalist rather than a specialist. The significantly positive coefficient of the difference in co-authors\u2019 specialization supports this narrative.
